## General overview

This in material for the Course Project of the JHU's Data Science Specialization course *Getting and Cleaning Data* (getdata-032).

This project submit: 

1. a tidy data set as described below,
2. a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 
3. a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 

Project include also this README.md document. This document explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

## Data

The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

## Tidy data set

In this project has created one R script called *run_analysis.R* that does the following. 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
